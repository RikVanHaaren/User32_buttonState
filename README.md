# User32_buttonState
.NET 6.0 console application, button state via user32.dll


## Problem
I had the issue that my application needed to check how long an button was held by the user. First I tried the `Console.ReadKey();` but this function lets the program wait for a key press.


## Solution
With P/Invoke we can acces the structs, callbacks and functions in the unmanaged libraries from our managed code. This is how we can acces the *user32.dll* to get the virtual key stroke states.


## Usages
### Import user32.dll
**C# signature:**
```
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
[DllImport("USER32.dll")]
```
*OR*
```
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("USER32.dll")]
```

**Example**
```
// Import P/Invoke
[DllImport("USER32.dll")]
static extern short GetKeyState(int nVirtKey);

while (true) {
    if(Convert.ToBoolean(GetKeyState(0x20) & 0x8000)) 
        Console.WriteLine("Spacebar is pressed down!");
}
```
*Note: The a look at the [Project](https://github.com/RikVanHaaren/User32_buttonState/tree/main/User32_buttonState)  so you can include the virtual keys by enum.*
